# RFM Analysis and Sales Analysis Dashboard

This GitHub repository contains a comprehensive project focused on leveraging RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis to perform customer segmentation and uncover insights about customer behavior. The project utilizes SQL to implement the RFM analysis, allowing for the identification of distinct customer groups based on their purchasing patterns.

Additionally, the repository includes SQL queries and scripts to identify which products are frequently purchased together. This association analysis provides valuable information for cross-selling and upselling strategies, enabling businesses to optimize their product offerings and increase revenue.
